# Nixt

## Synopsis

Simple and powerful end-to-end testing for command-line apps.

## Description

Nixt is aiming to make testing of command-line apps as simple as possible. It
plays nice with the testing tools that you are already using and in case you are
one of those guys who practice outside-in BDD, it has the potential to become
something that lives in every command-line app that you are going to build.
